This cutlet recipe needs no introduction, it is simply the most easy appetizer which can be prepared in just a few minutes by following some simple steps. Take a deep fry pan and Heat oil in a pan over moderate flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, add cumin seeds.

Once the cumin seeds start to splutter, add chopped garlic and grated ginger. Fry until light golden. Make sure that the flame is on low so that the ginger and garlic doesn't get burnt. Once the raw flavour of garlic-ginger is gone, add chopped onions and saut√© until soft.

Wait for the onions to turn slightly translucent in colour. Then add finely chopped carrot and capsicum and saute for few minutes over moderate-high flame. Take it off the heat, transfer in a bowl and allow the mixture to cool for a while.

In a large bowl, add boiled potatoes, shredded chicken, sauteed vegetable, green chilies, garam masala powder, oregano, cumin powder, bread crumbs, coriander leaves and mix well. Divide the mixture into equal lemon sized balls and shape each of them into a patty.

Take each patty, coat it well with flour. Then dip the patty in beaten egg and coat it with bread crumbs. Again dip the patty in the egg and then coat it with bread crumbs. Repeat the same for all. This step is important as it will give a crunchy texture to the cutlets. Place the cutlets on the tray lined with butter paper and freeze it for 3-4 hours.

Heat oil in a deep pan over moderate flame and fry the cutlets until crisp and golden brown. Pair these delicious cutlets with some onion ring and serve them hot with ketchup, sauce or dip of your choice.
